# SYMBA-FI
SYMBA-FI project
Repository for SYMBA-FI: An offshoot of the main SYMBA project with the goal of extending SYMBA's capabilities to calculate square amplitudes directly from potentially complex Feynman Diagrams/Feynman Integrals. 

At present (8/18/23) this space is a placeholder for future new/modified code for the project.

**Current status:** Determining a systematic way to supplement given Feynman Integrals with additional propagators so that FIRE6 can be used to generate a training dataset of FIs written in terms of master integrals, MIs.
